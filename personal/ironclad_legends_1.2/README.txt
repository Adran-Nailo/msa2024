Currently, rpg_game_v2 uses a rendering system of colored squares, and is mostly stable, though it might get a bit glitchy if you get too close to an edge. rpg_game_v2 copy.py is the one that uses actual textures, though many textures have not been imported yet. the dev_files are files that are uneeded for the game, and are files that are used primarily for the development of the game.
